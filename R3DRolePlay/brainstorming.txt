each character will have a specific faction that they are apart of
but also a reputation level with all factions
the reputation level with a faction will change as the character interacts with the faction
once the reputation level reaches a certain point, they can join the faction, or get kicked out
when kicked out of a faction, the character is put into the civilian faction
the civilian faction cannot be joined directly
a character can leave a faction at any time, putting them in the civilian faction, and giving them a severe reduction in reputation in the faction they left, as well as a minor reduction in all others (not trustworthy)

factions:
union
phoenix
civilian

civilian faction is neutral
union and phoenix factions oppose each other

killing members of a faction decreases reputation with faction, and increases reputation with opposing factions
reputation with civilian faction will decay to neutral over time
trading with members of a faction increases reputation with faction, and decreases reputation with opposing factions

reputation:
  0 - total hatred
 13 - wanted dead
 25 - kicked out
 50 - neutral
 75 - can join
100 - total friend

skills:
looting (percentage of inventory accessible when looting loot chests and bodies)
charisma (influence on NPCs when in conversation, effects prices when trading)
thief (percentage of inventory accessible when looting characters and locked chests)
key smith (effects qualities of crafted locks)
lock picking (effects chances of unlocking a locked door)

skill range 0-100

looting range: percentage of inventory is skill level
charisma rage:
	conversation - to be determined
	trading - end price = (1 - (charisma / 200)) * initial price
thief range:
	looting characters - percentage of inventory is skill level
	looting locked chest - percentage of inventory is skill level minus lock quality
key smith range: lock quality is skill level
lock picking range: chance of unlocking is skill level minus lock quality

random values for skills are generated with fixed seeds, so that a player with lock picking 1 can't successfully unlock a level 100 lock simply by just trying 100 times

when a player dies, they respawn at their spawn point, but 50% of their inventory is left in a body where they died
a player will always be able to see 100% of the inventory when looting their own body
special items are ignored when calculating which items are left behind
bodies decay after 1 hour
